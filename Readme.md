I gave myself about 6.5 hours to do as much as I possibly could to make it as fair to the other students as possible.

I tried to use bootcamp only with minimal CSS. I'm not sure if this is how Bootstrap is meant to be used as I found it very difficult to style, size and position elements.
These are some of the issues I encountered with this approach:


1- Resizing the nav bar to make it responsive, hide the link text and display icons only.
2- Applying margin and padding on many of the elements
3- Overall positioning of elements. I could not get the 'class="justify-content-center"' to work with d-flex.
4- Smooth transitions with my responsive design.

I found Bootstrap to be quite the challenge!
